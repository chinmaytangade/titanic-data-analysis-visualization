## 🎯 Objective
Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to find insights about passengers and survival rates.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)  
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## 📊 Key Insights
- Most passengers were from **3rd class**  
- **Females** survived more than males  
- **1st class** had higher survival rate  
- Higher **fare → higher survival chance**  
- **Younger passengers** survived slightly more
